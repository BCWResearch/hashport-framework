# hashport widget

This project is a simple example of how easy it is to get started with the `@hashport/widget`. In a terminal, run the following command:

```bash
npm install && npm run dev
```

This example uses the `LazyHashportWidget` component, which is a lazy loaded dialog. It is set up to work on `testnet`. For more information on how to get your accounts set up to test transactions, refer to the [`@hashport/react-client` README](../../../react-client/README.md#development-environment).
